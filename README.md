# kickstarter_2nd_project

## Project Requirements:
1. Try different (at least 3) machine learning algorithms to check which performs best on the problem at hand
2. What would be the right performance metric- precision, recall, accuracy, F1 score, or something else? (Check TPR?)


## Objective of the Analysis 
Launched in 2009, **Kickstarter** is one of the world's leading crowdfunding platforms. As of December 2019, Kickstarter has received more than $4.6 billion in pledges from 17.2 million backers to fund 445,000 projects, such as films, music, stage shows, comics, journalism, video games, technology, publishing, and food-related projects. It's mission is to bring "*creative projects to life*"

Kickstarter has an all-or-nothing funding model, whereby a project is only funded if it meets its goal amount; otherwise no money is given by backers to a project.
A huge variety of factors contribute to the success or failure of a project — in general, and also on Kickstarter. Some of these are able to be quantified or categorized, which allows for the construction of a model to attempt to predict whether a project will succeed or not.

## Task
Primary business objective is to provide creators with a recommendation on how to launch a successful Kickstarter campaign!

Determine which factors decide whether or not a project will achieved is funding goal.

## Repository

This repository contains the **data**, the **jupyter notebook** and the slides of the **presentation** as a pdf file.
The notebook is structured according to the Datascience-Lifecycle. That means:
1. Business Understanding
2. Data Mining
3. Data Cleaning
4. Data Exploration
5. Feature Engineering
6. Predictive Modeling
7. Data Visualization


Images for the presentation are  saved in the folder **images** .
